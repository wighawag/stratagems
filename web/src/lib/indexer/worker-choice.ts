/**
 * WHICH INDEXER WORKER A GAME'S STATE RUNS, and the name it is given.
 *
 * - A chain in this tab (an offline world, `isEmbeddedChainId`) is indexed by
 *   the game's WORLD worker (`hostWorldIndexer`): no tab election, since no
 *   other tab can reach this tab's chain, and no publication, since nobody
 *   publishes a snapshot of a world. Its IndexedDB database is named after the
 *   world (the name below, which carries the minted chain id), kept across
 *   reloads, and deleted with the world (`deleteWorldIndex`).
 * - Any other chain is indexed by the game's LIVE worker (`hostLiveIndexer`),
 *   ONE TAB INDEXING and the others reading, under an election named PER
 *   DEPLOYMENT (chain and game address). etherfold names the election by what
 *   the worker is told, so a name shared across deployments would have an online
 *   tab and a world in another tab contend for one lease, and the loser read a
 *   database nobody wrote (found in stratagems, step O of its plan).
 *
 * The name crosses as the worker's own (`new Worker(url, {name})`, read there as
 * `self.name`), because the worker's code is fixed at build time and the
 * deployment is not.
 *
 * `prefix` is the GAME's: a short lower-case word naming it (stratagems says
 * `stratagems`), so two games served from one origin never share a database.
