# 👾🌍 An Autonomous World In Constant Evolution

[Stratagems](https://stratagems.world) is an game where players are actual gods. They are literaly the one creating the world and its inhabitants.

Stratagems is an [Autonomous World](https://0xparc.org/blog/autonomous-worlds) and is thus permission-less and persistent. Its rules are immutable yet it is fully composable and as a community players can bring new dimensions to the world all permissionlessly.

We expand on that idea in our latest essay: ["Natural Compoability in Autonomous Worlds"](https://etherplay.io/blog/natural-composability/).

## ♟️ What is stratagems exactly ?

<img align="right" style="width:200px" src="docs/public/icon.png">
Stratagems is a world created by players and anyone can join at any time. Players use a specific set of factions to compete for control of the world. Alliances and betrayal are part of the arsenal as factions mixes around the world thus created.

Stratagems is thus first and foremost a social game. Its main inspiration is [Conquest.eth](https://conquest.game) who successfully created a deeply social game out of simple mechanics.

Stratagems explores this further by having even simpler rules. It also reduces the gas cost to a minimum by spreading the actions over a week. It works because most of the game plays out in the conversations and strategies happening among the players.

While maximally on-chain, Stratagems scales with players by offering compelling off-chain gameplay thanks to its associated social complexity.

## 🎮 How do you play ?

Players participate in the game by depositing ETH (ratio to be defined) to place a new piece of land on the endless sea. They specify its location and faction.

By doing so, they risk the associated ETH but also get a chance to potentially capture the same (and more) from other players.

More details coming soon! Follow our [twitter](https://twitter.com/stratagems_eth) or register your interest on our [website](https://stratagems.world)!

## 🎎 Who we are?

We are [Etherplay](https://etherplay.io), an Open Source Game Studio building Autonomous worlds.

We have been building fully on-chain games since 2016-[2017](https://etherplay.io/blog/our-first-unstoppable-game-tug-of-war/) and what we consider to be Autonomous Worlds since [early 2019](https://github.com/wighawag/the_eternal_dungeon/commit/b283988cccf37c63c290b5bd5465bfe5bb3dc7ad) following in the footsteps of [Huntercoin](https://xaya.io/huntercoin-legacy). We started our adventure with the aptly named "[Ethernal](https://ethernal.land/)" and then launched the autonomous version of [Conquest.eth](https://conquest.game) in April 2022 which will remain live until [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/), the chain it runs on, dies if ever (See our recent [announcement](https://etherplay.io/blog/conquest-is-open-source/)).

Our founder, [Ronan Sandford](https://ronan.eth.limo) is also an active developer in the web3 space with contributions towards EIP like [ERC-1155](https://ercs.ethereum.org/ERCS/erc-1155) and [ERC-2771](https://ercs.ethereum.org/ERCS/erc-2771), but also tools like [hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) and [Jolly-Roger](https://jolly-roger.eth.limo). He has been tinkering with on-chain NFTs with [Mandalas](https://mandalas.eth.limo) and [Bleeps](https://bleeps.art). You can find more on his [personal website](https://ronan.eth.limo).

## 💻 Install

> We are assuming here that you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed
>
> We also recommend to install [zellij](https://zellij.dev/)

1. Clone the repository

   > Before cloning you will need to have [git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.com/) installed

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/wighawag/stratagems.git
   cd stratagems
   ```

   Then, ensure the LFS hooks are present:

   ```sh
   git lfs install
   ```

   > If you installed git lfs after already cloning the repo, you will also need to execute the following:

   ```sh
   git lfs pull
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

3. Then Assuming you have [zellij](https://zellij.dev/) installed

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

   **And you are ready to go!**

> **Note** If you do not have [zellij](https://zellij.dev/) (on windows for example) you can use [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html)
>
> ```bash
> pnpm start:wezterm
> ```
>
> Or you can also launch each component in their own process
>
> ```bash
> pnpm local_node
> ```
>
> ```bash
> pnpm contracts:compile:watch
> ```
>
> ```bash
> pnpm contracts:deploy:watch
> ```
>
> ```bash
> pnpm indexer:dev
> ```
>
> ```bash
> pnpm web:dev
> ```

## 👾 Play

Just navigate to the url mentioned in the console. If you have no other thing running, it should be [http://localhost:5173/]()

## Deploying to a network

Just execute the following

```bash
pnpm contracts:deploy:prepare <network>
```

and it will ask you few questions and get your .env.local setup with the var needed to deploy on the network of your choice.

You just need to have a endpoint url and mnemonic ready for it.

You can of course configure it manually with more option if you need

Then you can deploy your contract

```bash
pnpm contracts:deploy <network>
```
